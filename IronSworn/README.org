* IronSworn

** Probabilities

The system of IronSworn is a bit unusual. In order to test a success, you have to roll 1D6, add a potential penalty or bonus and compare it to the result of 2D10:
- If the resulting number is inferior to the value of each of the D10, you fail;
- If your result is superior to only one of the D10, you have a weak success;
- If your result is above twice D10, you have a strong success.

The diagram below represents your chances per kind of bonus/penalty.

That reminds a lot the "Table des Paliers" of the Maléfices French RPG.
